Overall issues
==============

 * Documentation

 * Restructure to a Python package

libll
=====

 * Rewrite ll_source_images() as a general strong lensing tool,
   improving performace by introducing a two-level hierarchy.  The
   source would be provided as an image rather than as position and
   radius.  Integer conversion will be neccessary which can be avoided
   in the current version.  Performance?

User interface
==============

 * Add save and load (including FITS output)

 * Use cairo instead of client-side rendering

    * Beautify the light curve tool

     * Make the size of the light curve rendering dependent on the
       window size, not on the magnification pattern size

 * Make source image viewer a separate UI tool

 * Add some kind of statistics output (xrays, yrays, levels, time)

 * Improve performance (maybe reuse the pixbuf of the ImageView?)

 * Integrate the source profile tools into one tool

 * Let the user choose between magpat and convoluted magpat in the
   source path tool

 * Make the current main and config widget choosable independently

 * Restrict the history to a finite number of entries

 * Move plug-in treeview definition to gll.glade

 * Catch KeyErrors during pipeline run and give a useful message

 * Add fullscreen mode
