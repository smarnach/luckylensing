Overall issues
==============

 * Documentation

libll
=====

 * Rewrite ll_source_images() as a general strong lensing tool,
   improving performace by introducing a two-level hierarchy.  The
   source would be provided as an image rather than as position and
   radius.  Integer conversion will be neccessary which can be avoided
   in the current version.  Performance?

luckylensing.py
===============

 * Currently, the Python application still needs to know some details
   about the C layer.  For example, when changing the type of the
   counts in a magpattern from int to float, I needed to touch
   magpattern.py.  Maybe it is possible to improve encapsulation.

User interface
==============

 * Add save and load (including FITS output)

 * Make source image viewer a separate UI tool

 * Add some kind of statistics output (xrays, yrays, levels, time)
