Overall issues
==============

 * Documentation

 * Make y axis point in the correct direction in the images

libll
=====

 * Rewrite ll_source_images() as a general strong lensing tool,
   improving performace by introducing a two-level hierarchy.  The
   source would be provided as an image rather than as position and
   radius.  Integer conversion will be neccessary which can be avoided
   in the current version.  Performance?

 * Introduce consistent variable naming indicating whether lens plane,
   source plane or magnification pattern coordinates are used

luckylensing.py
===============

 * Currently, the Python application still needs to know some details
   about the C layer.  For example, when changing the type of the
   counts in a magpattern from int to float, I needed to touch
   magpattern.py.  Maybe it is possible to improve encapsulation.

User interface
==============

 * Introduce more sophisticated "data flow" layer

    * Add save and load (including FITS output)

 * Introduce support for multiple UI tools

 * Make source image viewer a separate UI tool

 * Add some kind of statistics output (xrays, yrays, levels, time)
